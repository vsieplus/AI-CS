## shiny

This directory contains code setting up the shiny app deployed [here](https://vsie.shinyapps.io/ai_custom_step).
It provides functionality for chart generation, as well as tools for visualizing
chart data, through a user interface.

You may also run it locally if you have R/shiny installed, with any models on
your own machine.
