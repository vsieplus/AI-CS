    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Thanks for visiting AI Custom Step! This project was inspired by
      <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06891' target='_blank'>Dance Dance Convolution</a> (Donahue et. al, 2017),
      and is an extension and adaptation of that project to Pump it Up. Many things were kept similar, but
      many modifications were also added. The linked paper has a great explanation of the approach taken
      towards step chart generation. If you're interested in learning more about this specific project and its implementation,
      you can check out the repository on <a href='https://github.com/vsieplus/AI-CS' target='_blank'>Github</a>.

    <h3>Decoding strategies</h3>
    <p> During step selection we use the outputs of the model to obtain a probability distribution over the
        different possible states of the dance pad. When choosing a step from this distribution there are a
        few different strategies we can take:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>top-p</strong>: sample from the smallest set of elements whose cumulative probability is > <i>p</i></li>
            <li><strong>top-k</strong>: sample from the set of elements with the <i>k</i>  highest probabilities</li>
            <li><strong>beam-search</strong>: at each timestep, keep the <i>b</i> most likely sequences from expanding all possibilities
                with the <i>b</i> most likely sequences from the previous timestep; at the end choose the one with the best score</li>
            <li><strong>greedy</strong>: pick the sample with the highest probability</li>
        </ul>

        From experimentation, top-p with <i>p</i> = 0.05-0.1 and top-k with <i>k</i> = 10-30 seem to give the most
        consistent and fluent sequence generations. Slightly higher values of p and k tend to work better for doubles than
        for singles. Beam search produces less consistent sequences, but can still be okay. Note that beam search will take 
        longer to run due to the more extensive search algorithm it uses. Greedy sampling tends to degenerate to repetition 
        very quickly, often generating the same pattern over and over. <br/><br/>

        If we make a comparison to how step makers select steps, it seems that top-p, top-k, and beam-search are 
        all reasonable approximations. At any given frame in the chart, our choice for the next step is often 
        influenced by the previous step(s), in order to create a sequence which flows well together (e.g. minimize 
        double stepping/awkward transitions). To do this, we may restrict the set of choices for the next
        step(s) depending on what we placed previously. <br/><br/> 
        
        Futhermore, the way in which we restrict these choices may also depend on what that previous arrow was. For example,
        in doubles, a step in the middle 4 gives many more viable options for the next step(s) then say one on the outer 4.
        This suggests that the strategy for step selection may be closer top-p sampling rather than top-k or beam-search,
        as the number of candidates to sample from may change depending on the previous state.

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Why is the song BPM optional?</strong> During chart generation the model is not explicitly aware of the precise
                number of beats per minute for the given audio track. When placing steps it merely breaks down the song into ~10ms intervals,
                and for each, decides whether to place a step there or not. Thus the BPM you feed during generation does not change the actual
                timing or placement of the steps, but rather only affects the chart's display and scroll speed. For Pump it Up this can actually be
                quite important because holds contribute to your combo count (e.g. we wouldn't want super high hold counts on a low bpm song). Note that 
                due to the lower density of lower BPM songs, some slight error may be introduced when converting from the actual model placement times. 
                Generally though, selecting a nice number (preferably something 6000 is nearly divisible by like 150-200) can reasonably keep consistent
                timing. Currently because of some conversion issues, for SSC files the bpm is fixed at around 600 bpm, so it is recommended to use auto velocity
                when playing. Hopefully this may be fixed in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>How can I play the generated chart?</strong> For official PIU UCS songs, you may upload ucs files with your
                account on the Pump it Up <a href='http://www.piugame.com/piu.ucs/ucs.intro/ucs.intro.php' target='_blank'>UCS site</a> and add 
                them to your profile. You may also play official and non-official song charts using <a href='http://stepf2.blogspot.com/' target='_blank'>StepF2/P1</a>
                with ssc files (put subfolders in a pack under the 'Songs/' folder). </li>
            <li><strong>Can I download the models to my computer?</strong> See the repository's master branch.</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Future work:</strong> Currently I have some ideas for different model architectures to perform step chart generation, and may work towards
        adding them to the project in the future (in particular, a transformer-like model). If you have any issues, questions, or suggestions feel free to 
        post on the Github repo.
