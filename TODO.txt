Short-term:
    - compare singles model w/wout conditioning
    - experiment with different holds representation
    - train doubles model with aicsv1_1 dataset
    - add shiny option to enter custom threshold for step placement
    - finish implementing training for transformer step selection model

Long-term:
    - brainstorm new representations of a 'stepchart'
    - experiment with ways to provide audio context during step selection
